									<h2><a href="https://github.com/ENG18CS0012-ABHISHEK/Heart-Attack-Prediction-Using-Machiene-Learning.git">Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Using Machine Learning<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>This project focuses on predictive modeling for heart attack risk using a dataset of 14 key health attributes, including age, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, and chest pain type. Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed significant correlations, such as the relationship between chest pain type and heart disease. Visualizations using Tableau provided insights into feature distributions and demographic patterns. Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest were implemented after preprocessing steps like data normalization. Random Forest emerged as the most accurate model with 80% accuracy, evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. This project highlights the application of machine learning in healthcare analytics for risk assessment and decision support.</p>

									<p>This project scrapes Tesla's historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using BeautifulSoup, organizing it into a structured dataset suitable for analysis. Visualizations created with Plotly Express highlight trends in stock prices and trading volumes over the past year. Using the Prophet library, a machine learning model is trained on the historical data to forecast stock prices for the next 30 days. The project also evaluates the accuracy of the forecast model by comparing predicted values with actual data, ensuring reliable insights. Although this project focuses on Tesla, the forecasting and visualization pipeline can be applied to any stock with available historical data. Key steps include web scraping, data cleaning, visualization, model training, and future price prediction, offering insights into stock performance and potential trends.</p>

									<a href="Paris Olympics Data Analysis Project.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/Paris.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline leveraging Microsoft Azure services and Power BI to analyze the Paris Olympics dataset sourced from Kaggle. The workflow involved using Azure Data Factory for creating automated data pipelines, Azure Data Lake for scalable data storage, and Azure Synapse Analytics for running SQL queries on processed data. The insights were visualized in Power BI dashboards, highlighting key metrics and trends. This project demonstrates expertise in ETL processes, cloud-based data solutions, and data visualization.</p>

									<a href="Airbnb Data Analysis and Visualization.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/AirBnB.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I used an Airbnb dataset extracted from Kaggle to explore and visualize key insights into the listings. The project began with extensive data cleaning operations to address missing values, correct inconsistencies, and ensure accuracy. Following the cleaning process, I used Tableau to create dynamic, interactive dashboards that highlight various aspects of Airbnb listings, such as pricing trends, geographic distribution, and listing types. These visualizations enable users to gain meaningful insights into market patterns, popular areas, and factors influencing booking rates, supporting data-driven decision-making for potential hosts and travelers alike.</p>

									</header>
									<a href="World Population Analysis.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/world-population-day.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project conducts an exploratory data analysis on a world population dataset from Kaggle, employing Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Key steps encompass data cleaning, statistical summaries, and uncovering patterns through correlation analysis and visualization. By grouping data by continent and examining population trends from 1970 to 2022, the analysis provides insights into population growth across regions. Visualizations, including heatmaps, line charts, and box plots, offer a comprehensive view of global population distribution and trends over time, revealing regional disparities and projecting growth patterns. This project ultimately aids in understanding demographic changes and potential future challenges related to population growth.</p>

									<a href="Layoffs Data Analysis.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/Layoffs_final.cms" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Layoffs Data Analysis project utilizes MySQL to clean and structure a layoffs dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset, containing key information such as company, location, industry, total layoffs, layoff percentage, date, stage, country, and funds raised, was imported into MySQL Workbench. I created three tablesâ€”layoffs for raw data, layoffs_stagging for intermediary data, and layoffs_stagging_2 for the final cleaned data. The cleaning operations involved handling missing values, formatting dates, and standardizing company and location names to ensure consistency. The final, cleaned data stored in layoffs_stagging_2 is ready for analysis and visualization, demonstrating my ability to prepare structured data for actionable insights.</p>
