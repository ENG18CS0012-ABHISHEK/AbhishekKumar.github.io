									<h1>Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting with Web Scraping and Prophet<br />

									<p>Using web scraping and the Prophet library, this project analyzes historical stock price data and forecasts future trends. By extracting data from Yahoo Finance and applying time-series analysis, it offers insights into stock performance and price projections.</p>

								<p>This project involves a comprehensive analysis and forecasting of Tesla’s stock prices, leveraging data scraped from Yahoo Finance using BeautifulSoup. By extracting and organizing this data into a structured format, we create a dataset optimized for in-depth analysis. Key phases include web scraping, data cleaning, visualization, model training, and forecasting, which together form a powerful pipeline that can be adapted for analyzing any stock with available historical data.</p>
								<p>The analysis begins by retrieving Tesla’s historical stock prices and trading volumes, which are then visually explored through dynamic charts created with Plotly Express. These visualizations highlight critical trends and seasonal patterns in Tesla’s stock behavior over the past year, helping to identify any notable fluctuations in price or trading activity.</p>
								<p>For forecasting, we train a time-series model using the Prophet library, a robust tool well-suited for making future predictions based on historical trends. This model is trained on Tesla’s historical data and is used to predict stock prices over the next 30 days, allowing for an insightful glimpse into potential future price trends.</p>
								<p>Although Tesla is the primary focus, the pipeline comprising web scraping, visualization, and machine learning forecasting can be easily adapted to other stocks. This project provides a framework not only for understanding stock market dynamics but also for applying predictive analytics in financial markets, making it valuable for both investment insights and general stock performance monitoring.</p>
